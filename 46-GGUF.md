# GGUF

## Overview

See also: [GGUF](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md)

> GGUF is a file format for storing **models for inference with GGML** and
> executors based on GGML. GGUF is a binary format that is designed for fast
> loading and saving of models, and for ease of reading. Models are
> traditionally developed using PyTorch or another framework, and then
> converted to GGUF for use in GGML.

Some format evolution:

> GGML, GGMF, GGJT, and now GGUF â€” and it is now at **version three** of the format.
